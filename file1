hi this is our first line
hello we have installed git in this server using yum install git comment
then we configured the git by using git config --global username "geetha"
g c g useremail "abc@gmail.com"
g c g editor vim
g c g compression 2
g c g difference vim.diff
we can check the verison of git using git --version
then we make a directory by mkdir mygit
then in this my git there will be files we view that through ls -lta
we need to initialize git in this my git directory by git init comment
after initializing .git in out mygit repo, we can see the files in the .git file and in the mygit repo
now,we create a file in this mygit directory and make changes to it by adding "hi" to the file
we add this file to staging area using git add filename comment
we commit to the local repository using commit git -m "message"
we can see if we have any uncommited chnages using git status
git diff will tell if there are any changes in files in the staging but havn't commited to local repository
git log tells us commit wise logs
git show <commit id> will tell us the changes made during a particular commit
we can get simple logs by git log -s
if we need all the commits detailed w can use git blame
